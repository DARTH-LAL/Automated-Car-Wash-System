# Automated-Car-Wash-System

This project involves the design and implementation of an automated Car Wash System using LabVIEW, a graphical programming environment widely used for control and automation applications. The system simulates a fully automated car wash process, including stages such as vehicle detection, pre-wash, soap application, brushing, rinsing, and drying.
